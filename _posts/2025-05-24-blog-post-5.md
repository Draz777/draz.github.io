## A brand new start

After a couple of days, I'm back with poor English.

After ten days of pure happy time, I return to my lonely normal life in the campus. But I have to say that rather than learning something during the semester, I prefer to go to the lab and finish something on my own with all my focus, without any disturbance. At the same time, as I dropped UGFH, I want to make good use of my summer time, besides doing the experiment which seems a bit easy for me, I especially hope to learn general relativity and quantum mechanics to better prepare for my future research career, learn to play the bass, learn Japanese to better communicate with locals met in my travels, learn Cantonese to better grab the opportunities in HK, update my blogs, edit videos as my vlogs, and of course improve my English skills, which is exactly the reason why I'm now using English to compose the lyrics of my blog. I have to say it's a bit unnatural for me and I feel a bit concerned if I could transpose my thoughts to you readers. What's more, I have recited TOEFL words for a lot of days but it's still hard to make use of them.

Maybe it's the advantage of using English that I don't have too much words to say. Here is the end of this post and hope you always a good day.

By the way, the application for New Asia summer research grant is unsuccessful just because the physics department has provided me enough money. Well it's a bit funny and I don't like this reason much. I have really prepared hard for it. But now I don't struggle to earn some money no matter from the department or from teaching others because I shouldn't waste a lot of time and energy on these to get just maybe my mom's one-day salary and happily share this with others like I have earned 100,000,000 dollars. I don't mean part-time job is not worthy. What I try to convey is that if I only just restrict my view to this modest amount and cherish the worth of every single penny, it's really tiring and not worthy.

Really the end.

After writing these, I asked AI to give comments on this blog and it said as follows. I have to say they make sense.

#### 1.  **Grammar and Sentence Structure**

Some sentences are a bit long or slightly awkward. Try breaking them into shorter, clearer parts. For example:

> Original: “After ten days of pure happy time, I return to my lonely normal life in the campus.”

> Improved: “After ten days of pure happiness, I’ve returned to my quiet, normal life on campus.”

**Tips**:

-   Use  **simple past**  or  **present perfect**  for recent experiences.
-   Watch out for  **prepositions**  (e.g., “on campus” instead of “in the campus”).

#### 2.  **Word Choice and Natural Phrasing**

Some phrases feel translated from another language. For example:

> “I don’t have too much words to say.” → “I don’t have many words to say.”

> “Transpose my thoughts to you readers.” → “Convey my thoughts to you, the readers.”

**Tip**: Reading blogs or essays by native speakers can help you get a feel for natural phrasing.
